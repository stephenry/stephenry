### Welcome to my Github profile!

I'm Steve, Scottish :scotland: computer engineer :computer:. Welcome to my Github profile! I maintain and develop a collection of computer architecture related hardware (SystemVerilog) and software (C++)" related projects. Please check out some of my projects:

- [Pool Allocator](http://www.github.com/stephenry/pa) A production quality Pool Allocator subsystem for an enterprise-class Network Processor (NPU) and associated C++17 verification environment.

- [Cache Coherency Simulator](http://www.github.com/stephenry/cc) A event-driven Cache Coherency protocol simulator for multiprocessor System-On-Chips (SOC). 

- [Financial Matching Engine](http://www.github.com/stephenry/ob) A high-performance financial :dollar: matching engine for FPGA targets.

- [Hardware Quicksort](http://www.github.com/stephenry/qs) A novel (and pointless) implementation of the common quicksort algorithm in hardware (as a microcoded sequencer).

- [Logic Design Interview Questions](http://www.github.com/stephenry/hw_interview_questions) A set of common hardware related design questions, for those interested in a career in the semiconductor industry (not recommended!).
