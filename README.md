### Welcome to my Github profile!

I'm Steve, Scottish :scotland: computer engineer :computer: and semiconductor professional (:disappointed:). Welcome to my Github profile! I maintain and develop a collection of computer architecture related hardware (SystemVerilog) and software (C++) projects. Please check out some of my projects:

I am based in both the US (Bay Area) :us: and UK (London) :uk: and share dual-UK/-USA nationality :customs:. I currently write C++ in London. I am not actively seeking employment, but if you are interested in collaborating, get in touch :telephone:. Please forgive my use of Emoji.
