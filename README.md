### Welcome to my Github profile!

I'm Steve, Scottish :scotland: computer engineer :computer: and semiconductor professional (:disappointed:). Welcome to my Github profile! I maintain and develop a collection of computer architecture related hardware (SystemVerilog) and software (C++) projects. Please check out some of my projects:

 - [__Pool Allocator__](http://www.github.com/stephenry/pa) A production quality Pool Allocator subsystem for an enterprise-class Network     Processor (NPU) and associated C++17 verification environment.

- [__Cache Coherency Simulator__](http://www.github.com/stephenry/cc) A C++17 event-driven Cache Coherency protocol simulator for multiprocessor System-On-Chips (SOC). 

- [__Financial Matching Engine__](http://www.github.com/stephenry/ob) A high-performance financial :dollar: matching engine for FPGA targets.

- [__Hardware Quicksort__](http://www.github.com/stephenry/qs) A novel implementation of the common quicksort algorithm in hardware (as a microcoded sequencer).

- [__Packet Parser__](http://www.github.com/stephenry/m) A packet matching design example.

- [__Logic Design Interview Questions__](http://www.github.com/stephenry/hw_interview_questions) A set of common hardware related design questions, for those interested in a career in the semiconductor industry.

I am based in both the US (Bay Area) :us: and UK (London) :uk: and share dual-UK/-USA nationality :customs:. I currently write C++ in London. I am not actively seeking employment, but if you are interested in collaborating, get in touch :telephone:.
